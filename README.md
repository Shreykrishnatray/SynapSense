# SynapSense

SynapSense is an AI-powered goal-to-action companion that transforms vague ideas into clear, structured plans...
It uses GPT to break goals into tasks, milestones, and timelines â€” then visualizes them as interactive mindmaps and Gantt charts.
Built with FastAPI, React, MongoDB, and OpenAI API.

Ideal for students, freelancers, and professionals who want clarity and structure...
